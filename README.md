# Bakdrive_data branch

Find driver species from real metagenomic data and simulate fecal microbial transplantation FMT process

## **Files:**

### **1. scripts folder**

PCoA.py: script is used to generate PCoA plots of simulated data

boxplot.py: script is used to generate boxplots of simulated data

bubble.py: script is used to generate the bubble & agreement bar plot of real rCDI data

### **2. data**
sign_change: contains all species in disease samples abundance change of direction and their agreement to prediction. 

First column is species name; second column is the abundances changes after FMT in real samples; thrid column is the agreement of direction changes between simulation data after driver species introduction and real data after FMT.
